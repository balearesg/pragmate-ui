## About

Pragmate UI is an advanced React UI library fine-tuned for BeyondJS. It specializes in delivering on-demand components
with minimal bundle impact, and it streamlines the UI/UX development process, so you can focus on building rather than
boilerplate.

## Installation

To get started with Pragmate UI, run:

```bash
npm install pragmate-ui
```

## Features

-   **On-Demand Components**: Eliminate dead code by importing only what you actually use.
-   **Streamlined Implementation**: Intuitive, easy-to-use components for accelerated development.
-   **Responsive & Accessible**: Best practices are baked in, providing a seamless user experience across all devices.
-   **Design Excellence**: Components come with a well-thought-out UI/UX, balancing form and function beautifully.

## On-Demand, Modular Usage

In Pragmate UI, components are modular and accessible via subpaths, allowing you to import only what you need:

```typescript
// For using a button component
import { Button } from 'pragmate-ui/components';
// For using toast notifications
import { Toast } from 'pragmate-ui/components/toast';
```

This approach keeps your bundle lean, ensuring you don‚Äôt include unnecessary code.
