# Badge Component

The Badge component is a versatile component that allows you to display badges with different colors and values.

### Installation

To use the Badge component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install the component's dependencies if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    npm install react
    ```

2. Import the Badge component into your project:

    ```javascript
    import { Badge } from './Badge';
    ```

### Usage

You can use the Badge component by including it in your JSX code and passing the necessary props:

```javascript
<Badge variant="primary" value={3}>
	Notifications
</Badge>
```

### Props

The Badge component accepts the following props:

-   `variant` (string, optional): Defines the color variant of the badge. Possible values are 'primary', 'secondary',
    'success', 'danger', 'warning', 'info', or 'default'. If not provided, it defaults to 'default'.
-   `value` (number, required): The numeric value to be displayed inside the badge.
-   `children` (ReactNode, required): The content you want to display next to the badge.

### Examples

```javascript
<Badge variant="primary" value={3}>
  Notifications
</Badge>

<Badge variant="success" value={10}>
  Messages
</Badge>

<Badge variant="danger" value={1}>
  Error
</Badge>
```

### Styling

The Badge component is styled using SCSS, and you can customize its appearance by modifying the SCSS variables. The
available color variables are:

-   `--primary`
-   `--secondary`
-   `--success`
-   `--danger`
-   `--warning`
-   `--info`
-   `--default`

You can override these variables to change the badge's colors to match your project's design.

customization.
